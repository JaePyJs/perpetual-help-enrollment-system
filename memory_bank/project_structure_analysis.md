# Project Structure Analysis

## Current Project Structure

The project currently consists of three main components:

1. **Backend (`enrollment-backend/`)**: 
   - Express.js API server with MongoDB database
   - Comprehensive API endpoints for authentication, student management, etc.
   - Security middleware (CSRF, XSS protection, rate limiting)
   - WebSocket server for real-time notifications
   - JWT-based authentication

2. **Original Frontend (`enrollment-frontend/`)**:
   - HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementation
   - Working API integration with the backend
   - Functional but with less preferred design
   - Tailwind CSS for styling

3. **New Frontend (`enrollment-system (1)/`)**:
   - Next.js with TypeScript and modern component architecture
   - Better design with shadcn components
   - App directory structure with proper routing
   - Currently using mock data instead of real API integration
   - Authentication issues with inconsistent token storage

## Key Issues Identified

### Backend Issues
- Backend server starts but doesn't respond to requests
- WebSocket server initialization may be causing connectivity issues
- CSRF protection middleware may be blocking legitimate requests
- No detailed error logging for debugging connectivity issues

### Frontend Integration Issues
- New frontend uses mock data instead of real API integration
- Authentication in new frontend is inconsistent:
  - Middleware uses cookies for token storage
  - Auth context uses localStorage for token storage
- Navigation between pages in new frontend has issues
- No proper error handling for API failures

### Data Flow Issues
- No proper loading states for API calls
- No error states for API failures
- Hardcoded mock data instead of dynamic data from API

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Backend Issues
1. Temporarily disable WebSocket server to isolate issues
2. Simplify CORS and CSRF configuration for development
3. Add detailed logging to identify bottlenecks
4. Create comprehensive API testing suite for all endpoints

### Phase 2: Integrate New Frontend with Backend
1. Update auth-context.tsx to properly handle API responses and errors
2. Ensure token storage is consistent (either cookies or localStorage)
3. Update middleware.ts to match the token storage method
4. Replace mock data with real API calls in student dashboard
5. Implement proper loading states and error handling
6. Create API service layer for reusable API calls

### Phase 3: Complete Feature Implementation
1. Implement student features:
   - Course enrollment
   - Grade viewing
   - Schedule management
   - Profile management
2. Implement teacher features:
   - Student management
   - Grade submission
   - Course management
3. Implement admin features:
   - User management
   - System configuration
   - Reports and analytics

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement
1. Implement end-to-end testing for complete user flows
2. Improve responsive design and accessibility
3. Optimize performance with caching strategies
4. Final cleanup of unused code and files
