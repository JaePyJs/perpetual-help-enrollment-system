## Current status

- Project has two frontend implementations:
  1. Original frontend (`enrollment-frontend/`) with working functionality but less preferred design
  2. New frontend (`enrollment-system (1)/`) with better design but functionality issues
- Backend (`enrollment-backend/`) has comprehensive API endpoints but connectivity issues
- Backend server starts but doesn't respond to requests (likely middleware or WebSocket issues)
- New frontend uses Next.js with TypeScript and modern component architecture
- New frontend has mock data instead of real API integration
- Authentication in new frontend is inconsistent (middleware uses cookies, auth context uses localStorage)
- CSRF protection in backend may be blocking legitimate requests
- Original frontend has working API integration but outdated design
- **Documentation in memory_bank is now streamlined and up to date.**
- **Backend robustness review completed; authentication routes enhanced with comprehensive validation and improved security.**
- **ThemeRegistry.tsx refactored for SSR/client emotion cache and theme switching.**
- **Created ProtectedRoute component for authentication and role-based access control.**
- **Implemented GradesVisualization component with semester breakdown and GPA calculation.**
- **Added FinancialDashboard component with account summary, transaction history, and payment processing.**
- **Fixed accessibility issues by adding proper button type attributes and ARIA labels.**

## Known issues

- ⚠️ Backend server starts but doesn't respond to requests (likely middleware or WebSocket issues)
- ⚠️ CSRF protection in backend may be blocking legitimate requests
- ⚠️ Authentication in new frontend is inconsistent (middleware uses cookies, auth context uses localStorage)
- ⚠️ New frontend uses mock data instead of real API integration
- ⚠️ Navigation between pages in new frontend has issues
- Need to improve responsive design for all device sizes
- Need to continue improving accessibility compliance with ARIA attributes and semantic HTML
- Complex state management needed for data-intensive components
- Need to implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Need to enhance error handling for edge cases
- Need to fix WebSocket initialization in backend server
- Need to resolve token storage inconsistency between middleware and auth context

## Evolution of project decisions

- Created two separate frontend implementations:
  1. Original frontend with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS and working API integration
  2. New frontend with Next.js, TypeScript, and modern component architecture
- Identified need to merge functionality from original frontend with design from new frontend
- Discovered backend connectivity issues that need to be resolved before integration
- Decided to focus on fixing backend issues before continuing frontend integration
- Planned phased approach to migration:
  1. Fix backend connectivity issues
  2. Integrate new frontend with backend
  3. Complete feature implementation
  4. Testing and refinement
- Implemented JWT-based authentication with token refresh
- Moved from CSS variables to React context for theme management
- Organized CSS into modular files for better maintainability
- Implemented TypeScript for improved code quality and developer experience
- Created shared theme context to maintain consistency across components
- Addressed CSS import issues with proper app directory structure
- Migrated inline styles to CSS modules for better maintainability
- Implemented comprehensive API client for backend integration
- Added proper error handling and loading states for API calls
- User registration page now enforces strict role-based registration and ID generation/validation for each role
- Only global admin can create admins, only admin can create teachers/students, teachers can only register students, and students cannot register anyone

## Recommendations and Next Steps (May 2025)

### Phase 1: Fix Backend Issues

- Fix backend connectivity issues by disabling WebSocket server temporarily
- Simplify CORS and CSRF configuration for development
- Add detailed logging to identify bottlenecks
- Create comprehensive API testing suite for all endpoints

### Phase 2: Integrate New Frontend with Backend

- Update auth-context.tsx to properly handle API responses and errors
- Ensure token storage is consistent (either cookies or localStorage)
- Update middleware.ts to match the token storage method
- Replace mock data with real API calls in student dashboard
- Implement proper loading states and error handling
- Create API service layer for reusable API calls

### Phase 3: Complete Feature Implementation

- Implement student features (course enrollment, grade viewing, schedule management)
- Implement teacher features (student management, grade submission)
- Implement admin features (user management, system configuration)
- Create finance page with transaction history and payment options

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement

- Implement end-to-end testing for complete user flows
- Improve responsive design and accessibility
- Optimize performance with caching strategies
- Legacy HTML, JS, and CSS files in enrollment-frontend/ identified for review and removal if not referenced by the Next.js app
- Design guideline markdowns to be consolidated or archived if outdated
- reference/ directory to be reviewed for unnecessary files
- UI/UX design review for Next.js app recommended to ensure consistency and accessibility
- Unused styles and components in Next.js app to be removed for maintainability
