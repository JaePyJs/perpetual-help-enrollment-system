## What works

- Memory bank core files initialized and populated with comprehensive project details.
- Documentation structure in place for ongoing project tracking.
- Migrated login page to Next.js with Supabase Auth integration.
- Migrated teacher, student, and admin dashboards to React components.
- Migrated student enrollment page to React component.
- Migrated user registration page to Next.js (`user-registration.tsx`, `user-registration.module.css`).
- Implemented theme switching (light/dark) using React context/provider.
- TypeScript interfaces and types implemented for better code quality.
- Fixed package dependencies (added Supabase libraries).
- Set up proper project structure with CSS modules.
- Created Supabase client in TypeScript.
- Organized styles according to Next.js best practices.
- Replaced HTML links with Next.js Link components.
- Converted inline styles to CSS modules.
- Added proper TypeScript typing for event handlers.
- Implemented consistent navigation patterns across dashboards.
- **Unnecessary documentation files in memory_bank have been deleted for clarity.**

## What's left to build

- Connect all components to Supabase for dynamic data.
- Implement proper data fetching and state management (React Query or SWR).
- Set up authentication flows with proper redirects.
- Migrate remaining pages:
  - Student profile page
  - Financial dashboard/payment pages
  - Grade tracking and academic records
  - Course management interfaces
- Add comprehensive error handling throughout application.
- Implement loading states and optimistic UI updates.
- Create reusable components for common UI elements.
- Improve responsive design for all device sizes.
- Add accessibility improvements (WCAG).
- Implement unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
- Prepare deployment pipeline.

## Current status

- Frontend migration to Next.js in progress.
- Core pages migrated to React components.
- CSS organization improved with modular structure and CSS modules.
- Supabase client implementation added with TypeScript support.
- Package dependencies updated with required Supabase libraries.
- Project structure aligned with Next.js best practices.
- **Documentation in memory_bank is now streamlined and up to date.**

## Known issues

- Backend APIs not yet connected to the frontend interfaces.
- Need to implement loading states and optimistic UI updates.
- Need to improve responsive design for all device sizes.
- Need to ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG standards).
- Authentication flows need proper redirects and error handling.
- Complex state management needed for data-intensive components.
- Form validation needs to be implemented throughout the application.

## Evolution of project decisions

- Migrated from vanilla HTML/CSS/JS to Next.js React components.
- Implemented Supabase Auth for authentication.
- Moved from CSS variables to React context for theme management.
- Organized CSS into modular files for better maintainability.
- Implemented TypeScript for improved code quality and developer experience.
- Created shared theme context to maintain consistency across components.
- Addressed CSS import issues with proper app directory structure.
- Migrated inline styles to CSS modules for better maintainability.
- User registration page now enforces strict role-based registration and ID generation/validation for each role.
- Only global admin can create admins, only admin can create teachers/students, teachers can only register students, and students cannot register anyone.
