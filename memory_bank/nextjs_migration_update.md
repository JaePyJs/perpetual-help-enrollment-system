# Next.js Migration & Modern UI Update (May 2025)

## Modern UI/UX System

- Introduced `modern-theme.css` as the new design system for the School Enrollment System.
- All color, font, and spacing tokens are defined as CSS variables for easy theming and consistency.
- Google Fonts (Poppins) is used for a clean, modern look.
- Theme switcher (light/dark/system) is available on all main pages.
- Responsive, card-based layouts and utility classes (flex, grid, gap, etc.) are used throughout.
- Buttons, inputs, and notifications are styled for clarity and accessibility.

## Refactored Pages

- **Landing Page (`index.html`)**: Modern, branded entry point with navigation to login and registration.
- **Login Page (`loginpage-improved.html`)**: Card-based, tabbed login for all roles, with theme switcher and toast feedback.
- **Registration Page (`user-registration.html`)**: Modern, clean form matching the login/landing style.
- **Access Denied (`access-denied-improved.html`)**: Consistent error page with branding and navigation.

## Code Quality & Problem Resolution

- All inline styles have been removed and replaced with utility classes or moved to the CSS file.
- All pages use only external CSS for maintainability.
- `modern-theme.css` has no errors (see #problems attachment).
- Utility classes (e.g., `.text-center`, `.text-danger`, `.mr-2`) are used for layout and color.
- All pages are now visually consistent and support the school's color base.

## May 2025: Heading Hierarchy Polish

- Improved heading hierarchy in `modern-theme.css`:
  - `h1` and `h2` are now larger and bolder for clear page/section titles.
  - `h3`â€“`h6` are slightly smaller and less bold for better structure.
- This change enhances visual clarity and professionalism across all pages.

## May 2025: Type Safety Improvements

- Replaced all `as any` type assertions in student-profile page with `as string` for select fields (gender, civil_status).
- This resolves all major TypeScript warnings and improves code robustness.
- All frontend forms now use explicit types for select and input fields.

## Next Steps

- Use these templates for all future dashboard and panel pages.
- Continue to expand utility classes and components as needed for new features.
- Continue to polish and modernize all UI components and layouts for even more visual appeal and usability.
