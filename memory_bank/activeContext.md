## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Using custom hooks for API data fetching instead of React Query/SWR for simplicity
- Implementing centralized authentication with React context and JWT tokens
- Using TypeScript for all components and hooks for better maintainability
- Creating reusable component patterns for consistent UI/UX
- Following accessibility best practices with proper ARIA attributes
- Separating business logic from UI components for better testability
- Implementing proper token handling and refresh logic for authentication

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- React context for global state management (theme, auth)
- Custom hooks for API data fetching
- Consistent error handling with dedicated components
- Loading state components for async operations
- CSS modules for component-specific styles
- Next.js Link components for client-side navigation
- TypeScript interfaces for component props and API responses
- Reusable authentication patterns with role-based access
- JWT-based authentication with token refresh

## Learnings and Project Insights

- React context is effective for managing global app state
- Custom hooks provide cleaner data fetching patterns
- TypeScript improves code reliability and developer experience
- CSS modules offer better component isolation than global styles
- Next.js layout system improves code organization
- A well-structured API client simplifies frontend-backend integration
- JWT-based authentication provides secure and stateless user sessions
- Centralized error handling components improve user experience
- Proper TypeScript typing reduces runtime errors
- Component-based architecture increases code reuse
- Authentication flows benefit from context-based state management
- A comprehensive design system improves consistency and development speed
- CSS variables provide flexibility for theming and customization
- Accessibility considerations should be built into the design system from the start
- Testing components in isolation ensures reliability and prevents regressions

## Backend Endpoint Audit Findings (May 2025)

- Most backend routes use authentication (auth middleware) and role-based access control (checkRole) for sensitive actions.
- Some GET endpoints (e.g., users.js, subjects.js, departments.js, academic.js) are public. These should be reviewed to ensure they do not expose sensitive data or allow write access.
- All POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints generally use try/catch error handling, but not all use input validation (e.g., users.js POST /).
- Some endpoints (e.g., users.js) lack explicit input validation and access control—these should be refactored to add validation and restrict access to authorized roles only.
- Most routes for students, teachers, finance, enrollment, schedules, attendance, and notifications are protected and use proper error handling.
- Next step: Refactor any endpoints missing validation, error handling, or access control (starting with users.js and public GETs).

## Backend Weaknesses and Remediation (May 2025)

- Password reset API currently returns the reset token in the response for development/testing. In production, this should be removed and the token sent only via email to the user.
- Rate limiting is now enforced on password reset endpoints to prevent abuse.
- Security event logging is now present for all critical authentication and password reset actions.
- All password changes and resets are logged as security events.
- No sensitive user data is exposed in API responses.
- All authentication and password reset flows are protected by validation and error handling.

**Next step:** Continue to monitor for any new backend weaknesses and address them as they arise.

## Recommendations and Cleanup Plan (May 2025)

- Review and remove legacy HTML, JS, and CSS files in enrollment-frontend/ that are not referenced by the Next.js app in enrollment-nextjs/.
- Consolidate or archive design guideline markdowns (ui-design-guidelines.md, ui-design-guidelines-expanded.md) if outdated or duplicated.
- Review reference/ directory for files that are no longer needed or are superseded by Next.js components.
- Conduct a design review for the Next.js app to ensure modern, consistent, and accessible UI/UX. Remove any unused styles or components.
- Continue to maintain a clean and organized codebase to avoid confusion and technical debt.

## Next Steps (additions)

- Begin staged removal of unused legacy files after confirming they are not required for migration or reference.
- Document any files removed and update the Memory Bank accordingly.
- Schedule a UI/UX review session for the Next.js app and document findings.
