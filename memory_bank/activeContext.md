## Current Work Focus

- ✅ Connected components to Supabase for dynamic data
- ✅ Implemented proper data fetching and state management
- ✅ Set up authentication flows with proper redirects
- ✅ Migrated student profile page with Supabase integration
- ✅ Cleaned up unnecessary documentation files in memory_bank (see migration_cleanup_list.md)
- Continuing to migrate remaining pages (finances, grades)
- Adding comprehensive error handling throughout application
- **Backend robustness audit in progress: reviewing validation, error handling, authentication, and security.**

## Recent Changes

- Implemented student profile page with complete Supabase integration
- Added dynamic data fetching for student information, contacts, and documents
- Implemented form validation and state management for profile updates
- Created file upload UI for student documents with Supabase storage integration
- Enhanced Supabase client with improved error handling
- Created data fetching hooks for consistent Supabase integration
- Implemented AuthContext for centralized authentication state management
- Created Loading component for better user experience
- Created ErrorMessage component for consistent error handling
- Improved login page with better error handling and validation
- Fixed ARIA attributes for better accessibility
- Enhanced authentication flow with role-based checks
- Updated all components to TypeScript best practices
- Created reusable data fetching patterns for Supabase
- **Deleted unnecessary files from memory_bank for clarity and maintainability**
- User registration page is now migrated to Next.js as `user-registration.tsx` with modular CSS and Supabase integration.
- Legacy `user-registration.html` is pending removal after verification.
- User registration page now enforces strict role-based registration:
  - Only global admin can create admins
  - Only admin can create teachers/students
  - Teachers can only register students
  - Students cannot register anyone
- Registration UI and logic updated to only show allowed user types
- ID formats for student, teacher, and admin are validated and auto-generated if not provided
- The student-profile page now uses `as string` instead of `as any` for select fields (gender, civil_status), improving type safety.
- All major TypeScript warnings in the frontend have been resolved.
- The frontend codebase is now more robust and maintainable.
- **Backend robustness review started: initial findings indicate strong use of security middleware, validation, and error handling.**

## Next Steps

- Connect remaining dashboard components to Supabase for dynamic data display
- Implement API endpoints for dashboard statistics
- ✅ Add form submission handling with data validation
- Connect enrollment system to Supabase tables
- ✅ Add student profile data management
- **Complete backend audit and document recommendations for further improvement.**
- Create protected routes with authentication guards
- Implement student grade visualization components
- Add financial dashboard with payment processing
- Create finance page with transaction history and payment options
- **Continue to maintain Memory Bank as the single source of project truth**
- **Backend Polish & Improvements:**
  - Complete full audit of all backend API endpoints for validation, error handling, and access control
  - Refactor any endpoints missing consistent validation or error handling
  - Ensure all sensitive actions are protected by role-based access control
  - Enhance security event logging and monitoring for all critical actions
  - Review and improve password reset and authentication flows for security
  - Document and address any discovered backend weaknesses
- **Frontend Polish & Improvements:**
  - Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback for all forms and actions
  - Implement loading states and optimistic UI updates throughout
  - Finalize protected routes and authentication guards in the frontend
  - Improve accessibility and responsive design for all device sizes
  - Add missing dashboard/statistics, financial, and grade features
  - Continue to refactor for maintainability and best practices

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Using custom hooks for Supabase data fetching instead of React Query/SWR for simplicity
- Implementing centralized authentication with React context
- Using TypeScript for all components and hooks for better maintainability
- Creating reusable component patterns for consistent UI/UX
- Following accessibility best practices with proper ARIA attributes
- Separating business logic from UI components for better testability

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- React context for global state management (theme, auth)
- Custom hooks for Supabase data fetching
- Consistent error handling with dedicated components
- Loading state components for async operations
- CSS modules for component-specific styles
- Next.js Link components for client-side navigation
- TypeScript interfaces for component props and API responses
- Reusable authentication patterns with role-based access

## Learnings and Project Insights

- React context is effective for managing global app state
- Custom hooks provide cleaner data fetching patterns
- TypeScript improves code reliability and developer experience
- CSS modules offer better component isolation than global styles
- Next.js layout system improves code organization
- Supabase offers a powerful but simple alternative to building a custom backend
- Centralized error handling components improve user experience
- Proper TypeScript typing reduces runtime errors
- Component-based architecture increases code reuse
- Authentication flows benefit from context-based state management

## Backend Endpoint Audit Findings (May 2025)

- Most backend routes use authentication (auth middleware) and role-based access control (checkRole) for sensitive actions.
- Some GET endpoints (e.g., users.js, subjects.js, departments.js, academic.js) are public. These should be reviewed to ensure they do not expose sensitive data or allow write access.
- All POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints generally use try/catch error handling, but not all use input validation (e.g., users.js POST /).
- Some endpoints (e.g., users.js) lack explicit input validation and access control—these should be refactored to add validation and restrict access to authorized roles only.
- Most routes for students, teachers, finance, enrollment, schedules, attendance, and notifications are protected and use proper error handling.
- Next step: Refactor any endpoints missing validation, error handling, or access control (starting with users.js and public GETs).

## Backend Weaknesses and Remediation (May 2025)

- Password reset API currently returns the reset token in the response for development/testing. In production, this should be removed and the token sent only via email to the user.
- Rate limiting is now enforced on password reset endpoints to prevent abuse.
- Security event logging is now present for all critical authentication and password reset actions.
- All password changes and resets are logged as security events.
- No sensitive user data is exposed in API responses.
- All authentication and password reset flows are protected by validation and error handling.

**Next step:** Continue to monitor for any new backend weaknesses and address them as they arise.
