## Purpose

This file describes why the project exists, the problems it solves, how it should work, and user experience goals.

## Why this project exists

The School Enrollment System for Perpetual Help College of Manila exists to modernize and streamline the academic administration process. It aims to replace manual, paper-based processes with a digital solution that improves efficiency for both students and staff, while providing better data management and reporting capabilities for the institution.

## Problems it solves

- Manual enrollment processes that are time-consuming and error-prone
- Limited accessibility to course registration outside of business hours
- Difficulty for students to track their academic progress and finances
- Inefficient communication between students, faculty, and administration
- Challenges in course planning and resource allocation
- Limited visibility into enrollment trends and student performance metrics

## How it should work

### For Students

1. Log in with secure credentials
2. View their dashboard with current courses, grades, and important announcements
3. Browse available courses with filtering options
4. Select courses and add them to a registration cart
5. Review selected courses and confirm enrollment
6. Access schedules, grades, and financial information
7. Receive notifications about important deadlines and events

### For Administrators

1. Manage course offerings and schedules
2. Process and approve student enrollments
3. Track enrollment statistics and generate reports
4. Manage user accounts and permissions
5. Configure system settings and academic calendars

## User experience goals

- Intuitive enrollment process with shopping cart-like experience
- Clear feedback for all actions with status indicators
- Secure handling of user data with proper authentication
- Responsive and accessible UI that works across devices
- Visual consistency with institutional branding
- Theme options (light/dark) for user comfort and accessibility
- Clear navigation with logical information architecture
- Real-time updates for enrollment status and availability
- Helpful error messaging and guided workflows

## Security and Reliability Goals

- All user data is protected with strong validation and sanitization on both frontend and backend
- Authentication and authorization are enforced for all sensitive actions
- Security best practices (XSS, CSRF, rate limiting, password hashing, error handling) are implemented throughout
- System is designed to prevent data leaks and unauthorized access
- Audit logging and monitoring are in place for accountability

## May 2025: Type Safety and Robustness

- Frontend forms (especially student-profile) now use explicit string types for select fields.
- All major TypeScript warnings are resolved in the frontend.
- Backend validation and error handling should be reviewed for production use.

## Current Implementation Status

- Project has two frontend implementations:
  1. Original frontend (`enrollment-frontend/`) with working functionality but less preferred design
  2. New frontend (`enrollment-system (1)/`) with better design but functionality issues
- Backend (`enrollment-backend/`) has comprehensive API endpoints but connectivity issues
- Need to migrate functionality from original frontend to new frontend while keeping the new design
- Backend server has connectivity issues that need to be resolved
- Authentication in new frontend is inconsistent (middleware uses cookies, auth context uses localStorage)
- New frontend uses mock data instead of real API integration

## Migration Plan

- Phase 1: Fix Backend Issues

  - Fix backend connectivity issues by disabling WebSocket server temporarily
  - Simplify CORS and CSRF configuration for development
  - Add detailed logging to identify bottlenecks
  - Create comprehensive API testing suite for all endpoints

- Phase 2: Integrate New Frontend with Backend

  - Update auth-context.tsx to properly handle API responses and errors
  - Ensure token storage is consistent (either cookies or localStorage)
  - Update middleware.ts to match the token storage method
  - Replace mock data with real API calls in student dashboard

- Phase 3: Complete Feature Implementation

  - Implement student features (course enrollment, grade viewing, schedule management)
  - Implement teacher features (student management, grade submission)
  - Implement admin features (user management, system configuration)

- Phase 4: Testing and Refinement
  - Implement end-to-end testing for complete user flows
  - Improve responsive design and accessibility
  - Optimize performance with caching strategies
