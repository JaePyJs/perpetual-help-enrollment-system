## Overview

The School Enrollment System for Perpetual Help College of Manila is a comprehensive digital platform designed to modernize and streamline the academic administration process. The system aims to provide a seamless experience for students, faculty, and administrators by digitizing enrollment, course management, grade reporting, and other essential academic functions.

## Core Requirements

1. **User Authentication and Management**

   - Secure login for all user types
   - Role-based access control
   - Profile management

2. **Course Management**

   - Course catalog with detailed information
   - Schedule management
   - Prerequisite enforcement
   - Capacity management

3. **Enrollment Process**

   - Course registration with shopping cart functionality
   - Waitlist management
   - Schedule conflict detection
   - Fee calculation and payment integration

4. **Academic Records**

   - Grade submission and viewing
   - Transcript generation
   - Academic standing calculation
   - Degree progress tracking

5. **Communication**

   - Announcements and notifications
   - Messaging between users
   - Automated alerts for important deadlines

6. **Reporting and Analytics**
   - Enrollment statistics
   - Grade distribution reports
   - Attendance tracking
   - Custom report generation

## Technical Requirements

- Responsive web design for access on various devices
- Secure data handling and privacy protection
- Scalable architecture to handle peak enrollment periods
- Accessible interfaces following WCAG guidelines
- Theme system with light/dark mode options
- Integration between frontend and backend components
- Consistent token storage and authentication flow
- Proper error handling and loading states for API calls
- Comprehensive API testing suite for all endpoints

## Security and Robustness Commitments

- All API endpoints use input validation and sanitization
- XSS, CSRF, and HTTP parameter pollution protections are enforced
- Passwords are hashed and validated for strength
- Role-based access control is strictly enforced
- Error handling middleware prevents sensitive data leaks
- Rate limiting and secure session/cookie handling are in place
- Security event logging and monitoring are implemented
- Regular backend audits are performed to ensure continued robustness

## Success Metrics

- Reduction in administrative processing time
- Increased student satisfaction with enrollment process
- Decreased error rates in course registration
- Improved data accuracy and reporting capabilities

## Current Project Status

- Project has two frontend implementations:
  1. Original frontend (`enrollment-frontend/`) with working functionality but less preferred design
  2. New frontend (`enrollment-system (1)/`) with better design but functionality issues
- Backend (`enrollment-backend/`) has comprehensive API endpoints but connectivity issues
- Need to migrate functionality from original frontend to new frontend while keeping the new design
- Backend server has connectivity issues that need to be resolved
- Authentication in new frontend is inconsistent (middleware uses cookies, auth context uses localStorage)
- New frontend uses mock data instead of real API integration

## Implementation Plan

- Phase 1: Fix Backend Issues

  - Fix backend connectivity issues by disabling WebSocket server temporarily
  - Simplify CORS and CSRF configuration for development
  - Add detailed logging to identify bottlenecks
  - Create comprehensive API testing suite for all endpoints

- Phase 2: Integrate New Frontend with Backend

  - Update auth-context.tsx to properly handle API responses and errors
  - Ensure token storage is consistent (either cookies or localStorage)
  - Update middleware.ts to match the token storage method
  - Replace mock data with real API calls in student dashboard

- Phase 3: Complete Feature Implementation

  - Implement student features (course enrollment, grade viewing, schedule management)
  - Implement teacher features (student management, grade submission)
  - Implement admin features (user management, system configuration)

- Phase 4: Testing and Refinement
  - Implement end-to-end testing for complete user flows
  - Improve responsive design and accessibility
  - Optimize performance with caching strategies
