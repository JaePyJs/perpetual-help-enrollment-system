## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Hydration Mismatch in Next.js

**Issue**: Server-rendered HTML doesn't match client-side rendering, causing React errors.
**Solution**: Investigating component rendering patterns and ensuring consistent data between server and client.

### Challenge: CSS Organization

**Issue**: Need for consistent styling across the application.
**Solution**: Implementing a structured CSS approach with proper file organization and component-specific styles.

### Challenge: MongoDB Connection

**Issue**: Ensuring reliable database connection and proper data modeling.
**Solution**: Implementing connection pooling and robust error handling for database operations.

### Challenge: Navigation Structure

**Issue**: Ensuring proper navigation between pages with correct routing in Next.js.
**Solution**: Creating proper page structure in the app directory and implementing correct routing between pages.

## Key Decisions and Changes

### Architecture Decisions

- Adopted a clear separation between frontend and backend
- Chose MongoDB for flexible schema design
- Implemented JWT-based authentication

### Design Decisions

- Selected orange (#e77f33) as primary color
- Added deep blue-teal as secondary color (complementary to orange)
- Incorporated rich purple as accent color for highlights
- Chose Inter and Poppins as typography
- Adopted a component-based UI architecture
- Implemented modern animations and microinteractions
- Used glassmorphism and gradient effects for visual interest
- Enhanced color contrast for better accessibility

### Process Changes

- Established memory bank documentation for knowledge sharing
- Implemented server configuration for proper development workflow

## Metrics and Progress Indicators

### Development Metrics

- **Backend Completion**: ~20%
- **Frontend Completion**: ~25%
- **Design System Implementation**: ~40%
- **Documentation Completion**: ~70%
- **Testing Coverage**: ~5%

### Key Performance Indicators
