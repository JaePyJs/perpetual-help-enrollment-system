# Active Context

## Current Development Focus

As of May 16, 2025, the School Enrollment System development is focused on the following areas:

### System Setup and Configuration

- Setting up the development environment with proper server configurations
- Resolving port conflicts between backend and frontend servers
- Implementing proper navigation between different parts of the system
- Creating comprehensive documentation in the memory bank

### Frontend Development

- Implementing the design system based on the primary orange color (#e77f33) with complementary colors
- Creating responsive UI components with modern animations and microinteractions
- Setting up proper CSS organization and styling architecture
- Addressing hydration issues in the Next.js application
- Implementing proper routing and navigation
- Ensuring smooth transitions and animations between pages and components

### Backend Development

- Setting up RESTful API endpoints for core functionality
- Implementing authentication and authorization
- Creating data models and database connections
- Ensuring proper error handling and validation

### Integration

- Connecting frontend and backend systems
- Ensuring proper communication between different parts of the application
- Setting up proper environment variables and configuration

## Current Challenges

### Technical Challenges

1. **Hydration Mismatch**: The Next.js application is experiencing hydration errors where server-rendered HTML doesn't match client-side rendering.
2. **CSS Organization**: Need to properly organize CSS files and implement the design system consistently.
3. **Port Configuration**: Ensuring proper port configuration for different servers (backend on 5000, frontend on 3000, navigation on 8080).
4. **MongoDB Connection**: Setting up reliable connection to MongoDB database.
5. **Navigation Structure**: Ensuring proper navigation between pages with correct routing in Next.js.

### Design Challenges

1. **Consistent Design System**: Implementing a cohesive design system across all components with complementary colors.
2. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the application works well on all device sizes.
3. **Accessibility**: Meeting WCAG compliance requirements for accessibility.
4. **Animation Performance**: Ensuring smooth animations and transitions without affecting performance.
5. **Visual Hierarchy**: Creating clear visual hierarchy with the updated color palette and typography.

### Functional Challenges

1. **User Authentication**: Implementing secure authentication with proper role-based access control.
2. **Enrollment Workflow**: Creating an intuitive enrollment process for students.
3. **Data Validation**: Ensuring proper validation of user inputs.

## Recent Decisions

1. **Server Configuration**:

   - Backend server to run on port 5000
   - Next.js frontend to run on port 3000
   - Navigation page to run on port 8080

2. **Design System Implementation**:

   - Primary color: Orange (#e77f33)
   - Secondary color: Deep Blue-Teal (complementary to orange)
   - Accent color: Rich Purple (for highlights and special elements)
   - Typography: Inter for body text, Poppins for headings
   - Component-based styling with CSS modules
   - Modern animations and microinteractions for enhanced user experience
   - Glassmorphism and gradient effects for visual interest

3. **Documentation Structure**:

   - Comprehensive memory bank documentation
   - Clear separation of concerns in documentation files

4. **Navigation Structure**:
   - Proper Next.js routing with app directory structure
   - Dashboard pages: /student-dashboard, /teacher-dashboard, /admin-dashboard
   - Profile pages: /student-profile
   - Registration page: /user-registration
   - Main navigation through index.html with links to all pages

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. Fix hydration issues in the Next.js application
2. Complete the implementation of core API endpoints
3. Implement proper authentication flow
4. Create basic UI components according to the design system
5. Fix navigation issues between pages
6. Ensure all routes are properly configured in Next.js
7. Optimize animations and transitions for better performance
8. Implement consistent design system across all pages
9. Fix image display issues with transparent backgrounds

### Short-term Goals

1. Complete student enrollment workflow
2. Implement teacher dashboard functionality
3. Create administrative interface for system management
4. Set up comprehensive testing framework

### Medium-term Goals

1. Implement payment processing
2. Add document management functionality
3. Create reporting and analytics features
4. Optimize performance and user experience

## Team Collaboration

### Communication Channels

- GitHub for code collaboration and version control
- Documentation in memory bank for knowledge sharing

### Development Workflow

1. Feature planning and documentation
2. Implementation with regular commits
3. Testing and validation
4. Code review and refinement
5. Documentation updates

## Current Environment

### Development Environment

- Local development setup
- MongoDB running locally
- Node.js backend server on port 5000
- Next.js frontend on port 3000
- Navigation page on port 8080

### Testing Environment

- Local testing with Jest and React Testing Library
- Manual testing of UI components and workflows

This active context document will be regularly updated to reflect the current state of development, recent decisions, and upcoming priorities for the School Enrollment System project.
